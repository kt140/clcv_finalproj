Greek God and Goddesses basic program.

The functionality of this program is to create a simple database for storing information about Greek Gods and Goddesses from Greek Mythology.
This is for my CLCV 115 class at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

To run the program simply run the main.py file and the program should be able to handle.

To add Gods and Goddesses, simply append information to the gods.py. To add information to the heroes section, simply append information to the 
heroes.py.
